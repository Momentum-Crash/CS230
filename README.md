**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
The Gaming Room was the client, they wanted me to design software so that they could integrate multiple different operating platforms and systems together. Specifically they wanted all of their clients to be able to play the game Draw It or Lose It together no matter what they chose to use as their hardware. Including but not limited to Android, iOS, Web Browsers, and other popular forms of accessing a modern day gaming application.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
I think the best part of my documentation was researching Ubuntu. For real world applications many business use LINUX servers and the most popular LINUX server from my research is Ubuntu. Many businesses implement it because it is cheap, has much documentation, and has already been used by many businesses making it popular.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
It created a frame of reference to start from which made some of the early framework easy to start developing. The design document acted as a point that could be gone back to and edited with new information but also keeps the focus of the project together. It is all too common for developers to start making an application thinking they understand what is needed and then get lost while developing. Having a focal point makes it easier for everyone to understand what is necessary for the client and what needs to be done to get to that point.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
I would change some of my recommendations going into further details about what possible pros and cons we would have to consider. I was afraid that I would bloat the document up too much but thinking about it more I would change that. I should have included more information on what kinds of support there is for the different platforms and some other common security considerations.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
I attempted to implement the usage of pointers in my software design to provide extra security. I believe it is important to advise against poor design choices based on experience and to speak up for the best solutions you can think of implementing. But ultimately the user needs must be the final choice because they will be the ones working with it in the long term. They need to understand what they have chosen to design and how you made it to fit their vision. By fitting the vision of the client everyone is on the same page about how to fix, maintain, or expand the project.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
I would like to read further about Maven and how it works to integrate the same implementation across different platforms. Some of what I was reading about it made sense right away while other information did not and took time and rereading to understand how it operates.
